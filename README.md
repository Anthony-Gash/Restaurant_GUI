# Restaurant_GUI
A GUI that could be used for a restaurant

## Description
A group designed Resturant GUI that is meant to replace a restaurant's current system. We desgined the GUI in SceneBuilder and coded the functionality in java. This was a group project, so the entire project was not completed by just me, I had two other group members who also contributed significantly.
